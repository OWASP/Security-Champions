## Security Policy

If you find a vulnerability anywhere in the Security Champions Guide project, such as the markdown source or scripts,
then please let the project admins know ASAP and we will fix it as a critical priority.

Open a [security advisory][advisory] which will be provided only to the project's admins and in strict confidence.
